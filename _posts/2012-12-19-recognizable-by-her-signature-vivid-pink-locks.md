title: Recognizable by her signature vivid-pink locks, Fried (or Ladyada, as she is
  known on the internet) is one of the dominant forces behind the maker movement–a
  legion of do-it-yourself-minded folks who create cool things by tweaking everyday
  technology. Last year New York City-based Adafruit did a booming $10 million trade
  in sales of DIY open-source electronic hardware kits, so-called because project
  designs are free and publicly accessible, and customers are encouraged to modify
  or “hack” the final product. In addition to MintyBoost ($19.50), the online catalog
  includes in-house designs like the iNecklace ($75), a pendant shaped like an Apple
  gadget’s “on” button, complete with a pulsing LED light; and third-party products
  that have earned the “Adafruit seal of approval,” like the MaKey MaKey ($49.95),
  a device that can turn any object that conducts electricity–a coin, cat, banana–into
  a functioning touchpad or keyboard.
