title: Of course, owning a gun is not a responsibility that everyone should assume.
  Most guns kept in the home will never be used for self-defense. They are, in fact,
  more likely to be used by an unstable person to threaten family members or to commit
  suicide. However, it seems to me that there is nothing irrational about judging
  oneself to be psychologically stable and fully committed to the safe handling and
  ethical use of firearms—if, indeed, one is.[1]
