title: Having successfully disregarded the Constitutional requirement to reapportion
  the House, Congress then put our government on the path to oligarchy by passing
  the “Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929” which established that, henceforth, the
  size of the House would be permanently fixed at “the then existing number of Representatives”.
  The “then existing number” being a verbose and inconspicuous way to specify 435.
