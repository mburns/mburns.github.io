<strong>Alan Smithee</strong> (also <strong>Allen Smithee</strong>) was an official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym" title="">pseudonym</a> used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="">film directors</a> who wish to disown a project, coined in 1968. Until its use was formally discontinued in 2000, it was the sole pseudonym used by members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_Guild_of_America" title="">Directors Guild of America</a> (DGA) when a director, dissatisfied with the final product, proved to the satisfaction of a guild panel that he or she had not been able to exercise creative control over a film. The director was also required by guild rules not to discuss the circumstances leading to the move or even to acknowledge being the actual director<sup>.</sup>
