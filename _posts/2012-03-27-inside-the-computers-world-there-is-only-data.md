title: 'Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. That which is not data, does
  not exist. Although all data is in essence just a sequence of bits1, and is thus
  fundamentally alike, every piece of data plays its own role. In JavaScript’s system,
  most of this data is neatly separated into things called values. Every value has
  a type, which determines the kind of role it can play. There are six basic types
  of values: Numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, and undefined values.'
