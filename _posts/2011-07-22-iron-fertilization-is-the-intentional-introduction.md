title: Iron fertilization is the intentional introduction of iron to the upper ocean
  to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom. This is intended to enhance biological productivity,
  which can benefit the marine food chain and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
  Iron is a trace element necessary for photosynthesis in all plants. It is highly
  insoluble in sea water and is often the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth.
