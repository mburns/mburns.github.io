title: You think about what long.sh does for a minute, and breathe a sigh of relief.
  The output is written to a file, so you donâ€™t care about terminal output. This means
  you can use disown. How does this little shell built-in let your jobs finish even
  when you kill the parent process (the shell inside the ssh connection)?
