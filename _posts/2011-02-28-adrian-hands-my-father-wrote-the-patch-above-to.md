  Adrian Hands (my father) wrote the patch above to improve the usability of
  gnome for himself and others. You see my dad was suffering from ALS and his
  hands were so crippled he could no longer use a keyboard. Thus we used a Darci
  usb morse code keyboard emulator to help him type. Even the morse code device
  was a struggle as the sensitivity adjustment and positioning of the nice two
  paddled key would fall out of whack. I rigged up a pvc cage that wrapped around
  his knee and fixed remote switches to the cage so that he could use the
  remaining strength in his legs to operate the Darci morse code device. He used
  this last bit of body movement to write this patch. Here is a photo of him using it:

  correspondence (he was in India for treatment, and I live in Raleigh). I would
  like to share the email with you.
