title: I spent the better part of the last decade at different startups and web companies,
  but one of my recent consulting gigs led me to a Fortune 500 company. I’ve done
  work at large enterprises before, but I really did forget what it’s like and it
  amounted to a rather jarring experience. I’ve entered a deep and dark world of enterprise
  architecture, frameworks, meaningless acronyms and a cesspool of “enterprise” software
  where it seems to breed and reproduce uncontrollably. It’s a place with abstraction
  at every layer, except anywhere that’s relevant.
