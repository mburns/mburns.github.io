title: 'Suleyman Ergun: There’s nothing like the feeling you get when you’ve got 100
  kilos of heroin in the trunk of your car. Just to be near it, to smell it. Driving
  along at 120 mph in France somewhere and thinking: “I know what I’ve got in the
  car.” Police stopping beside you. A gun under my seat. Wouldn’t think twice about
  shooting them. Taking the risk. At the end of the day that’s why I became a drug
  dealer. Not the money or the power, but the buzz.'
