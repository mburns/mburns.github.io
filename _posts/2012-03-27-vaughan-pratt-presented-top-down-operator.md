title: Vaughan Pratt presented “Top Down Operator Precedence” at the first annual
  Principles of Programming Languages Symposium in Boston in 1973. In the paper Pratt
  described a parsing technique that combines the best properties of Recursive Descent
  and Floyd’s Operator Precedence. It is easy to use. It feels a lot like Recursive
  Descent, but with the need for less code and with significantly better performance.
  He claimed the technique is simple to understand, trivial to implement, easy to
  use, extremely efficient, and very flexible. It is dynamic, providing support for
  truly extensible languages.
