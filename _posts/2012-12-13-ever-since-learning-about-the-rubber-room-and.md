title: Ever since learning about the Rubber Room and Blast Room deep below launch
  Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center I had been hopeful that I would one day get to photograph
  this mysterious remnant of the Apollo Program. I had seen very few photos of this
  room online and by talking to friends at KSC I seemed to have confirmed that access
  to this underground bunker had been very limited over the years. Following the end
  of the Shuttle Program and safing of the launch pads, access has become a little
  bit easier. There are two Rubber and Blast Rooms built to identical blueprints,
  one under launch pad 39A and another under 39B. Just recently, the rooms under 39B
  were closed off due to concerns from peeling lead based paints, which were commonly
  used during the era. Luckily for me, due to a different contractor building launch
  pad 39A, the Rubber and Blast Rooms were painted using non-lead based paint and
  is in much better shape allowing for the occasional visit. I would finally get the
  chance to enter the Rubber Room for an assignment with SpaceflightNow.
