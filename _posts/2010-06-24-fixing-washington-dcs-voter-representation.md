<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_retrocession#Proposed_Maryland_retrocession">Fixing Washington D.C.'s voter representation problem: shrink it.</a>

Residents in the 10 square mile District of Columbia don&rsquo;t have a senator to call their own, nor fair representation in the House. There should be no residents in the cradle of our government. Let&rsquo;s shrink the area of D.C. down to the just the capitol buildings and monuments we have, which only take up a fraction of D.C.
