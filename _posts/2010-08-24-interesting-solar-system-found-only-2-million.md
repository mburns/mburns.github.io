<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11070991">Interesting solar system found, only 2 million years wait to begin studying it up close</a>

A Swedish scientist discovered a solar system with 7 planets in a nice pattern similar to our solar system, rather a nice place for life you might say&hellip; The rub of it: if humans were so inclined to study the system and sent a craft at the fastest achieved speed (new horizons probe) to date for leaving solar orbit, it would only take 2 million years to get there.
