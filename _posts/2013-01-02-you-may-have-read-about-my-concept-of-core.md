title: You may have read about my concept of “core gifts”; the places of deepest sensitivity,
  tenderness and passion within us. These are the places of our greatest capacity
  to love and create—and they are also the places where most of us have been profoundly
  hurt. These gifts are strands of potential greatness within us, and when we express
  them we feel most alive and empowered–or most frighteningly vulnerable. Core gifts
  are not the same as strengths and talents. In fact, sometimes they feel like our
  greatest weaknesses.
