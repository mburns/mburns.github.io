title: he DOJ’s inspector general’s office performed an audit of cybersecurity staff
  at the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations. The audit examined 10 of the FBI’s
  56 field offices, which are designed to respond to cyberthreats. Of the 36 agents
  examined, 23 proved basically competent, but 13 “lacked the networking and counterintelligence
  expertise to investigate national security intrusion cases.” The report complains
  that some of that incompetence isn’t even the agents’ fault – it’s the fault of
  the FBI leade
