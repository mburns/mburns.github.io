<p class="MsoNormal">You were on your way home when you died.

<p class="MsoNormal">It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The <span class="SpellE">EMTs</span> tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.

<p class="MsoNormal">And that’s when you met me.

<p class="MsoNormal">“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”

<p class="MsoNormal">“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.

<p class="MsoNormal">“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”

<p class="MsoNormal">“Yup,” I said.

<p class="MsoNormal">“I… I died?”
