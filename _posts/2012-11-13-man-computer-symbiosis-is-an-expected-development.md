title: Man-computer symbiosis is an expected development in cooperative interaction
  between men and electronic computers. It will involve very close coupling between
  the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to
  let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution
  of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making
  decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined
  programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate
  the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines
  will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights
  and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate
  that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively
  than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective,
  cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory
  components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output
  equipment.
