title: But a new pipe was installed, the dirt was back in the hole, and our toilet
  was back on its best behavior. It was one of my favorite days ever. Thirty years
  later in San Francisco when my toilet blew up again. This time, I didnâ€™t participate
  in the repair process. I just called my landlord, left a check on the kitchen counter,
  and went to work. When I got home, the mess was cleaned up and the problem was solved.
