<blockquote>You give my mind a chance to be a little foul,

but I&rsquo;m definitely not on the prowl,

I&rsquo;ve just got big eyes like a great big owl, 

and a laugh just like a hyena howl, oh-oh</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu_Juz_-G0E">Sallie Ford and the Sound Outside - Not an Animal</a>
