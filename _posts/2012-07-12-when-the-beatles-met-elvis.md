For almost as long as theres been rock n roll, Los Angeles has been a city at the center of its history and mythol­ogya town in which legends are made, burned, rebuilt, merchandised, forgotten. The city has had its fair share of native rock talent and has been the adopted home of many more singular rockin careers, but the powerful draw of L.A. has also meant that, through the years, the city has been the site of some of the most notable and unusual rock n roll encounters.
