Forty years ago, Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian psychologist, conducted an epistolary courtship with a Ukrainian foreign language teacher named Klara. His letters to her weren&rsquo;t filled with reflections on her cherubic <a class="pt-basics-link" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/beauty" title="Psychology Today looks at Beauty">beauty</a> or vows of eternal love. Instead, they detailed a pedagogical experiment he was bent on carrying out with his future progeny. After studying the biographies of hundreds of great intellectuals, he had identified a common themeâ€”early and intensive specialization in a particular subject. Laszlo thought the public school system could be relied upon to produce mediocre minds. In contrast, he believed he could turn any healthy child into a prodigy. He had already published a book on the subject, <em>Bring Up Genius!</em>, and he needed a wife willing to jump on board.
