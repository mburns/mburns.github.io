title: 'This may well be the last time I speak on the House Floor. At the end of the
  year I’ll leave Congress after 23 years in office over a 36 year period. My goals
  in 1976 were the same as they are today: promote peace and prosperity by a strict
  adherence to the principles of individual liberty. It was my opinion, that the course
  the U.S. embarked on in the latter part of the 20th Century would bring us a major
  financial crisis and engulf us in a foreign policy that would overextend us and
  undermine our national security. To achieve the goals I sought, government would
  have had to shrink in size and scope, reduce spending, change the monetary system,
  and reject the unsustainable costs of policing the world and expanding the American
  Empire. The problems seemed to be overwhelming and impossible to solve, yet from
  my view point, just following the constraints placed on the federal government by
  the Constitution would have been a good place to start.'
