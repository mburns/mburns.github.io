title: I, Pencil, simple though I appear to be, merit your wonder and awe, a claim
  I shall attempt to prove. In fact, if you can understand me—no, that’s too much
  to ask of anyone—if you can become aware of the miraculousness which I symbolize,
  you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing. I have a profound
  lesson to teach. And I can teach this lesson better than can an automobile or an
  airplane or a mechanical dishwasher because—well, because I am seemingly so simple.
